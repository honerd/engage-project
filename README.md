# MyMusic App

## Description

This project involves the use of TF-IDF vectoriser in python to create recommendations based on your favourite songs and Then uses Spotipy to integrate users. For the purpose of this project this accesses my playlists and recent songs

<br />

## Tech-Stack Used

 1. Frontend: ReactJS
 2. Backend: Python Flask
 3. Machine Learning Algorithm Used: Scikit-learn TF-IDF vectoriser
 4. Language Used for ML: Python
 
# Setting the Project Up
 
## STEP 1: Downloading the Repository

Download the Repositry from the github page
<br />

<br />

## STEP 2: Setting up the Set Execution policy before creating the virtual environment

Open the powershell with admin access 
<br />
<img src="readmeimages/pic1.png" width="50%">
<br />

Execute the following Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted command and then answer Y to configure
<br />

<br />

## STEP 3: Configuring the files

Delete the package.json and package-lock.json from the mymusic folder and manifest.json from the ppublic folder
<br/>

<br />
<br/>
<img src="readmeimages/pic4.png" width="50%">
<br/>
<br/>

Download package.json, package-lock.json and manifest.json 
<br/>
<img src="readmeimages/pic5.png" width="50%">
<br />
<br/>
manifest.json is in public directory
<br/>
<br/>
<img src="readmeimages/pic6.png" width="50%">
<br/>
<br/>

Replacing the previously deleted files with the newly downloaded ones

<br/>
<br/>
<img src="readmeimages/pic8.png" width="50%">

## STEP 4: Adding the venv and setting up the frontend and backend
1. In the powershell terminal move to engage-project
    <br/>
    <br/>
    - pip install virtualenv 
    - virtualenv env
    - .\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
    
    <br />
    <img src="readmeimages/carbon.png" width="50%">
    <br/>
2. Install flask in the virtual environment
   <br/>
   <br />
   - pip install flask
   <br />
   <img src="readmeimages/flaskinstall.png" width="50%">
   <br />
3. Configuring the react
   <br />
   <br />
   - cd mymusic
   - npm install
   <br />
   <img src="readmeimages/npm.png" width="50%">
   <br/>
4. Moving back into the directory to run these pip commands
    <br />
    <br />
    - cd ..
    - pip install spotipy
    - pip install flask-cors
    - pip install pandas
    - pip install python-dotenv
    - pip install scikit-learn
    - pip install matplotlib
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src="readmeimages/npm.png" width="50%">
    <br />
   
5. Running flask to run the backend
    <br />
    <br />
    - flask run
    <br/>
    <br />
    <img src="readmeimages/flaskrun.png" width="50%">
    <br />
   
6. Start the react server
    <br />
    <br />
    - cd mymusic
    - npm start
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src="readmeimages/npmstart.png" width="50%">
    <br />
    
7. The page should load on localhost:3000 and the backend on localhost:5000

# Spotipy Integration

The project involves integration with the spotify API to fetch user libraries and songs and intergration with the spotipy library for python.
<br />
This library involves the use of user's playlist and songs that they like to produce recommendations and at the same time play songs in the real time. To play songs in the real time react-spotify-web-playback is used. Spotipy generates the access_token in a python environment thus rendering easy for flask development.

### NOTE: for the purpose of this project, I have added my client id and secret rather than putting the .env file in .gitignore

# TD-IDF Vectoriser

 - A tf-idf vectoriser is text frequency inverse document frequency vectoriser that generates featureset values according to the repetition of words in a fiven data-set
 - The more a word is repeated in a document, the lesser weight it holds
 - Using this suitable weights can be put into a genre of music that can be inturn used to create a dataset like this:
